Targoman: A robust Statistical Machine Translation framework     
===================
   Targoman is a robust Statistical Machine Translation framework which can use [moses](statmt.org/moses/) or [jane](www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/jane/) trained models to provide a robust decoding process. Further information can be found at [Targoman blog](http://blog.targoman.com/en/?cat=3).

See INSTALL for build instructions.

#####**Sub-directories Specification:**

> - **E4SMT**: Application based on TargomanTextProcessor which converts text to IXML and vice versa it also validates XML files and some more stuff.
> - **TargomanLoadBalancer**:Application that monitors translation servers and load-balances requests between them.
> - **TargomanSMTConsole**: Application based on TargomanSMT as a multithreaded console application. 
> - **TargomanSMTServer**: Application based on TargomanSMT as a multithreaded server application. This app comunicates with TargomanLoadBalancer and  can be set-up on clouds.
> - **TargomanWebAPI**: WebAPI to contact with TargomanLoadBalancer and do other DB based stuff. 
> - **TargomanWebUI**: WebInterface of Targoman 
> - **KenLM**: KenLM Langugae model library 
> - **TargomanLM**: Targoman Language Model Library 
> - **TargomanStem**: Targoman Stemmer Library  (Not yet published) 
> - **TargomanTextProcessor**: Targoman TextProcessor Library. Used to  normalize characters, tokenize text, tag special tokens and vice versa
> - **TargomanTransliterate**: Targoman Transliteration Library (Not yet published) 
> - **Scripts**: Train, Tune, and other usefull scripts (Not yet published)
> - **Samples**: Sample config file and corpora to test Targoman. 
> - **TargomanCommon**: Usefull and common tools as a compact library
> - **TargomanSMT**: Core Targoman SMT Library 
> - **Templates**: Templates used to generate subprojects 
> - **Tests**: BlackBox Tests

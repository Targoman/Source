 * @brief Loads     language model _file to _model.
 *
 * This is a sample of a ARPA language model:
 *
 * # Language models start with this tag.
 * \data\
 * # The first part of ARPA file, shows number of word(s) in each Gram.
 * ngram 1=7
 * ngram 2=7
 *
 * # In rest of the file, for each Gram these data are shown for each NGram:
 * # In the first column -log propabilty of NGram is shown.
 * # In the second column the string of NGram is shown.
 * # In the third column backoff weight of NGram is shown. Backoff weights are required only for those N-grams that form a prefix of longer N-grams in the model. The highest-order N-grams in particular will not need backoff weights (they would be useless).
 *
 * \1-grams:
 * -1.0000 <UNK>	-0.2553
 * -98.9366 <s>	 -0.3064
 * -1.0000 </s>	 0.0000
 * -0.6990 wood	 -0.2553
 * -0.6990 cindy	-0.2553
 * -0.6990 pittsburgh		-0.2553
 * -0.6990 jean	 -0.1973
 *
 * \2-grams:
 * -0.2553 <UNK> wood
 * -0.2553 <s> <UNK>
 * -0.2553 wood pittsburgh
 * -0.2553 cindy jean
 * -0.2553 pittsburgh cindy
 * -0.5563 jean </s>
 * -0.5563 jean wood
 *
 * # In the last part of ARPA file, there is this tag.
 * \end\
 *
 * @param _file     address of language model file.
 * @param _model    language model to initialized from model file.
 * @param _justVocab Indicates that we need to load just vocabulary so skip n-grams where n > 1
 * @param _skipVocab Indicates that we have previously loaded vocab so skip loading 1-gram
 * @return returns  order of n-gram
